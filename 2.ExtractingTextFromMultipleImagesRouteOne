In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract text from multiple images (method one).


In this tutorial, we will use the same packages that were employed in the process of extracting text from a single image. Please refer to the script titled '1.ExtractingJustTextFromOneImageOnly.' 
However, we will only install one additional library to build dataframes (Panda).
