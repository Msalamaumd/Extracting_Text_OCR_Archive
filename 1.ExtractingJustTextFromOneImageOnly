# Installation Instructions:
# You need to install the following libraries and system packages:
# pip install pytesseract pillow
# On Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
# Ensure you have Python and these packages installed before running the script.

import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

# pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine. It allows Python to recognize and read text
# embedded in images, which is particularly useful for reading text from documents, signs, or any images that contain text.

# Pillow (PIL Fork) is a Python Imaging Library. It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image
# file formats. It is necessary because pytesseract needs to interact with images, and Pillow provides the tools to handle
# image files easily in Python.

# tesseract-ocr is an open-source text recognition (OCR) Engine. It's used to recognize text from images and it's what
# pytesseract utilizes under the hood to perform OCR tasks. Installation of this package is crucial as the script will not
# function without it.

# Define the path to your image
image_path = "path/to/your/image.png"  # Example: "/content/badlayout1.1.png"

# Open the image using Pillow
image = Image.open(image_path)

# Perform OCR using pytesseract
extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image)

# Print the extracted text
print(extracted_text)
