# Use the script below if you want to extract text from a single image in JUST TWO DIRECT STEPS. ###FULL SCRIPT IS DOWN###

STEP ONE: You need to download the following libraries that we will be using here:
You need to install :
pip install pytesseract
pip install pillow
!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

#Pytesseract is a Python wrapper for Google's Tesseract-OCR Engine.
It will allow Python to recognize and read text embedded in images, which is particulary usseful for readnig text from documents, signs, or any images that contain text. 


#Pillow is a Python Imaging Library (PIL Fork). 
It adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different images file formats. It is ncesary because pytesseract  needs to interact with images, and Pillow provides the tools to handle image files easily in Python. 


#tesseract-ocr is an open-source text recognition (OCR) Engine [an actual software package]. 
It's used to recognize text from images and it's what pytesseract utilizes under the hood to perform OCR tasks.
This command is a must, and if you do not install it, you will encounter errors and be unable to complete the text extraction process.


#import pytesseract: this  imports the pytesseract library into your script or notebook.Once imported, you can use its functions to perform OCR tasks. 

#from PIL import Image: this imports the Image class from the Pillow library. 
This class is used to open image files and manipulate images, whih is often ncessary before passing them to pytesseract for text recognition.

STEP TWO: Write your script 
#Define the path of your image
variable_name = Image.open("path/to/image.file") Ex: badlayout_1 = Image.open("/content/badlayout1.1.png")

#Perform OCR using pytesseract
extracted_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(image_variable) Ex: text = pytesseract.image_to_string(badlayout_1)

#Print the outcome 
print(extracted_text)  Ex: print(text)




      ##### FULL SCRIPT####

pip install pytesseract
pip install pillow
!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image

badlayout_1 = Image.open("/content/badlayout1.1.png")
text = pytesseract.image_to_string(badlayout_1)
print(text)

###END###




Thanks ... Check other scripts if you want to know how to extract text from multiple images.
