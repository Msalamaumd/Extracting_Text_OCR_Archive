In this short tutorial, I will guide you through the process of extracting text from OCR old archives, specifically old scanned newspapers from the past two centuries.
These archived news pages are saved as images (PNG format).

Simply put, we will learn how to extract text from these images that contain content from old archived newspapers.

Learning Objectives:
1. You will learn how to install essential packages and libraries for handling OCR, images, and text extraction.
2. You will discover how to download other required libraries and packages if you are running your code from an online cloud-based platform such as Google Colab. Simply follow the exact steps, and apply them on your end.
3. You will learn how to extract text from a single image in just two simple direct steps.
4. You will learn how to extract text from multiple images. Here, we will explore two methods: one is easy but not recommended (depending on your needs), and the other is more efficient, allowing you to extract the text into a dataframe for further preprocessing procedures before running any advanced textual analysis.

If you have any inquiries or suggestions for alternative methods, please share them with me in the discussion.


Thanks, Mohamed Salama
