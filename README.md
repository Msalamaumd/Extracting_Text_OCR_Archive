`Extrcating Text from OCR Old Archives`


In this short tutorial, I will guide you through the process of extracting text from OCR old archives, specifically old scanned newspapers from the past two centuries.
These archived news pages are saved as images (PNG format).

Simply put, we will learn how to extract text from these images that contain content from old archived newspapers.

`You will learn how to extract text from multiple images. Here, we will explore two methods: one is easy but not recommended (depending on your needs), and the other is more efficient, allowing you to extract the text into a dataframe for further preprocessing procedures before running any advanced textual analysis`


If you have any inquiries or suggestions for alternative methods, please share them with me in the discussion.
