In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract text from multiple images (method two). ###FULL SCRIPT IS DOWN###

In this tutorial, we will use the same packages that were employed in the process of extracting text from a single image or multiple images.
Please refer to the scripts titled '1.ExtractingJustTextFromOneImageOnly.' and '2.ExtractingTextFromMultipleImagesMethodOne.'
However, we will only install one additional library to deal with multiple images in a directory.
