In this tutorial, we will explore how to extract text from multiple images (method two). ###FULL SCRIPT IS DOWN###

In this tutorial, we will use the same packages that were employed in the process of extracting text from a single image or multiple images.
Please refer to the scripts titled '1.ExtractingJustTextFromOneImageOnly.' and '2.ExtractingTextFromMultipleImagesMethodOne.'
However, we will only install one additional library to deal with multiple images in a directory. 



STEP ONE: You need to download the following libraries that we will be using here:
You need to install :
pip install pytesseract
pip install pillow
!sudo apt install tesseract-ocr
import pytesseract
from PIL import Image
import pandas as pd 
import os #new 

#os: is commonly used when you need to interface directly with the operating system or online patform to manage files, directories, and paths, or to access environment settings and execute system commands.
